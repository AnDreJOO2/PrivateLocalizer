# PrivateLocalizer
LSM project in my study using Weather api and google api

You can check your location, latitude and height, height above sea level, your movement speed, adress etc.
App has 2 switches to change frequency and baterry usage.
You can add pins on your locations to save them on the list. Then you can check info if you will click on pin. Of course you can search the city by the name and check its info.
Last but not least you can check the weather on your current location.

I was inspired by YT tutorials and docs with maps and wanted to try if I can use these tools and build an app to pass the final project in my studies.
I coded it 50/50 english polish.
